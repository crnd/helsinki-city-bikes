# Helsinki City Bikes

Helsinki City Bikes is a simple UI for quickly checking the status of [Helsinki City Bike stations](https://www.hsl.fi/en/citybikes). The site uses the [HERE JavaScript API](https://developer.here.com/develop/javascript-api) to provide maps and utilizes HTML5 geolocation and web storage.

Live city bike station status is fetched from a [public REST API](https://api.digitransit.fi/routing/v1/routers/hsl/bike_rental).
